# AtCoder Heuristic Contest 003

## Basic Strategy

For each query:
1. find and output the shortest path from _s_ to _t_ based on information got until now
2. Assume that the length of every edges including in the path is the given length divided by the number of the edges

## Usage

At first, download and build the official local tester in `./tools`.

| Command | Description |
|----|----|
| `make compile` | Compile `main.cpp` |
| `make test` | Execute `a.out` for an input file in `./tools/in/` (unless `TEST_IN` is specifed) |
| `make benchmark` | Execute `a.out` for all input files and summarize scores and execution times |
| `make compare-score` | Compare score file `./score.csv` with old one `./_score.csv` (unless `OLD_SCORE_FILE` is specified) |

See `Makefile` for details.

## Theoretical Score

`theoretical_score.tsv` shows the maximum score of each query, generated by the following oneliner:
```sh
echo -e "query#\tmax total score\tpercentage\tmax score\tpercentage" >theoretical_score.tsv; perl -E '$a=1;for(reverse 1..1000){$m+=($s[$_]=2312311*$a);$a*=0.998}for(1..1000){$s+=$s[$_];printf "%4d\t%22.10f\t%10.6f\t%18.10f\t%f\n", $_,$s,$s/$m*100, $s[$_],$s[$_]/$m*100;};' >>theoretical_score.tsv
```
